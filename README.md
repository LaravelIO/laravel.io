# Laravel.IO Community Portal

[![SensioLabsInsight](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/50a7431f-66b0-4221-8837-7ccf1924031e/mini.png)](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/50a7431f-66b0-4221-8837-7ccf1924031e)

This is the Laravel.IO community portal site. The site is entirely open source and community involvement is not only encouraged, but required in order to ensure the future success of the project.

## Requirements

We use Laravel Homestead for local development. Please review [the Homestead documentation](http://laravel.com/docs/homestead) to install it.

## Local Installation

Here are the steps for installation on a local machine.

1. Make sure you have [Laravel Homestead](http://laravel.com/docs/homestead) installed.
2. Clone this repository.

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:LaravelIO/laravel-io.git laravelio/
    cd laravelio/
    ```

3. Add the path for the cloned laravel.io repository to the `Homestead.yml` file under the `folders` list.
4. Add a site `lio.loc` for the laravel.io repository to the `Homestead.yml` file under the `sites` list.
5. Run `vagrant provision` in your Homestead folder.
6. Create a database in Homestead called `laravelio`.
7. SSH into your Homestead box, go to the laravel.io folder and run `./update_environment.sh`.
8. Add `127.0.0.1 lio.loc` to your hosts file.

You can now visit the app in your browser by surfing to [lio.loc:8000](http://lio.loc:8000).

## Github OAuth Configuration

Now, we must install the oauth configuration.

1. [Create an application](https://github.com/settings/applications) in your github account called something like "Laravel IO Development" and add your GH application's client id and secret to this config file. Your GitHub Application should be set up as follows:

    a. Full URL: http://lio.loc:8000  
    b. Callback URL: http://lio.loc:8000/login

2. Create the configuration file below at ***app/config/packages/artdarek/oauth-4-laravel/config.php***

```PHP
<?php

return [
    'storage' => 'Session',

    'consumers' => [
        'GitHub' => [
            'client_id'     => '',
            'client_secret' => '',
            'scope'         => ['user'],
        ],
    ],
];
```

## Frontend

**This section needs an update.**

Because we keep the generated / minified css out of the repository, we must have a workflow for compiling the styles.

* Install the latest NodeJS
* Finally, run "compass watch" in your /public folder and the minified css will be generated and also your filesystem will watch for file changes (and overwrites the .css). You can also run "compass compile" as a single one-time command to generate the css and don't watch the filesystem.

Please post proposals in the Github issues before coding up a PR.
